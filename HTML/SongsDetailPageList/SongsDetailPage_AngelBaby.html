I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell 
bring me back again
Play me the classics,
somethin' romantic
Give him my all 
when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a 
solemn face
Someone who feels 
like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, 
barely believin'
Startin' to think 
that I've lost all feelin'

You came out the blue 
on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you 
how I almost died
While you're bringin' 
me back to life

I just wanna live 
in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that 
livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up 
on the word "forever"
Until you gave up 
heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love 
with the little things
Countin' the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret and, 
baby, I'll keep it
And maybe we can play 
house for the weekend

You came out the blue 
on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how 
I almost died
While you're bringin' 
me back to life

I just wanna live in 
this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' 
couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on 
the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven 
so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights
that I've been waitin' for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in 
this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' 
couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word 
"forever" (Ooh, forever)
Until you gave up heaven 
so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
