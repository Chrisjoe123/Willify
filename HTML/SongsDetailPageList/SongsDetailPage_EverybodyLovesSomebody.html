Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds 
somebody someplace
There's no telling 
where love may appear
Something in 
my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every 
girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find 
what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made 
it well worth waiting
For someone like you
