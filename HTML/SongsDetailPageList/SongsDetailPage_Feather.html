Oh, not another take

Oh, it's like that,
I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back
when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm

I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying,
"No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked,
after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off

I feel so much lighter
like a feather 
with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories
like whatever, 
you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed,
you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype,
"Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter
like a feather 
with you out my life
With you out my life

like a feather, yeah

It feels so good
Not carin'
where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin'
to like the wine you like

I slam the door (Slam the door),
I hit ignore (Hit ignore)
I'm saying,
