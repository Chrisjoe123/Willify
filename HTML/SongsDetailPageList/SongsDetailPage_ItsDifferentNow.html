You understand my hesitation
Why I get quiet sometimes
All the ways I've been conditioned
What I think is real, 
you redesign (Ooh-ooh)
It's how you catch me 
every time (Ooh-ooh)
I rewind our 
conversations (Ooh-ooh)
Listen between 
every line (Ooh-ooh)
To relieve my 
superstition (Ooh-ooh)
I only reveal,
it's only a sign (Ooh-ooh)
That it all 
adds up this time (Ooh-ooh)
                        
I've been holding my hopes 
waist-high so they
don't tumble down
And keep me yesterday-bound
I've been holding my breath
'cause I don't wanna be let down
But we're too far for that now
So I'm saying it out loud
It's different now
                        

I don't need special
attention (Ooh-ooh)
Just as long as you are
mine (Ooh-ooh)
Then there's no reason
to mention (Ooh-ooh)
What came before,
the who or the why (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it all adds
up this time (Ooh-ooh)


I've been holding my hopes
waist-high so they don't
tumble down
And keep me yesterday-bound
I've been holding my breath
'cause I don't wanna be let down
But we're too far for that now
So I'm saying it out loud
It's different now


Didn't mean to push away,
make you think I'm so insane
It isn't gonna haunt me no more,
anymore, anymore
Stay forever and a day,
you'll never have
to ask again, no way
'Cause I can say

I've been holding my hopes
waist-high so they
don't tumble down
And keep me yesterday-bound
I've been holding my breath
'cause I don't wanna be let down
But we're too far for that now
So I'm saying it out loud
It's different now
