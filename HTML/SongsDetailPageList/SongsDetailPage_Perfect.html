I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive 
right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, 
beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew 
you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were
just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give
you up this time
But, darlin',
just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes,
you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass 
while listenin'
to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, 
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, 
"Darlin', you look perfect tonight"

Well, I found a woman
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that,
someday, I'll share her home
I found a love
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love,
to carry children of our own

We are still kids, 
but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be 
alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while
listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress,
lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin',
you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the 
dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, 
listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see,
now I know I have met
An angel in person and
she looks perfect
I don't deserve this,
you look perfect tonight
