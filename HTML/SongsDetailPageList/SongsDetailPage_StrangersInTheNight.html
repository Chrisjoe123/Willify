Strangers in the night 
exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, 
what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love 
before the night was through
                        
Something in your eyes 
was so inviting
Something in your smile 
was so exciting
Something in my heart 
told me I must have you
                        
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people,
we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when 
we said our first hello,
little did we know
Love was just a glance away, 
a warm embracing dance away and
                        
Ever since that night
we've been together
Lovers at first sight,
in love forever
It turned out so right
for strangers in the night
                        
Love was just a glance away,
a warm embracing dance away
                        
Ever since that night
we've been together
Lovers at first sight,
in love forever
It turned out so right
for strangers in the night
