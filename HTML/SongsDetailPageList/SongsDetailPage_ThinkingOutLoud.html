When your legs don't
work like they used to before
And I can't sweep
you off of your feet
Will your mouth still
remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still
smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be
lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could
still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in
love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in
love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, 
take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under 
the light of a thousand stars
And place your head 
on my beatin' heart,
I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love
right where we are

When my hair's all
but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds
don't remember my name
When my hands don't play
the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will
still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul
could never grow old,
it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's
forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love
in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just 
keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, 
take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the 
light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my 
beatin' heart,
I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love 
right where we are, oh-oh

Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love

So baby, now, take me 
into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a 
thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' 
heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love 
right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love 
right where we are
And we found love 
right where we are
