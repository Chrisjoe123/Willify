If I asked that boy to jump,
I know he would
He don't even have to say,
it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right
he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant,
still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where
I think I should be
Something told me that
it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high,
Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine,
feeding me like medicine, yeah

It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris

Yeah, I already have love in L.A. 

If you show me too much love,
it makes me leave
(Makes me leave)
Guess that's one of
many things that's wrong with me
(That's wrong with me)
Looking past you when
you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore,
I won't do that anymore (Anymore)
Why'd it take so long for
me to know this? (Know this)
Scared to put the water
with the roses (Roses)
Halfway 'cross the
world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah,
I notice, yeah

Je ne voulais pas
trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer,
d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
