Georgia
Wrap me up in all your—, I want ya
In my arms, oh, let me hold ya
I'll never let you go 
again like I did
Oh, I used to say
                        

"I would never fall in love again 
until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall 
unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness,
but then I found her
I found you
                        

Heaven
When I held you again
How could
We ever just be friends?
I would rather die 
than let you go
Juliet to your Romeo
How I heard you say
                        

"I would never fall in love again 
until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless 
it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness,
but then I found her
I found you

"I would never fall in love again
until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall
unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness,
but then I found her
I found you
